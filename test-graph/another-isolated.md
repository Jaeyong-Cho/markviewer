# Another Isolated File

This is a second orphaned file to demonstrate multiple disconnected components in the graph.

Like the [first isolated file](isolated-file.md), this will appear as a separate grey node.

Wait - that link actually connects these two orphaned files! So they're no longer truly isolated, but they form their own small component separate from the main documentation cluster.

This demonstrates how even small connections can create interesting graph structures.
