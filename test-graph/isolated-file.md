# Isolated File

This file demonstrates an orphaned node in the graph - it has no incoming or outgoing links to other markdown files in the collection.

Orphaned files appear in a different color in the graph visualization to help identify content that might need better integration with the rest of your documentation.

## What makes a file orphaned?

1. No incoming links from other files
2. No outgoing links to other files
3. Exists in isolation

## How to fix orphaned files

- Add links from relevant hub files like the main index
- Create connections to related topics
- Consider if the content should be merged with another file

This file will appear as a grey node in the graph view, separate from the main connected component.
