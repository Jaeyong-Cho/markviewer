# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for the graph visualization.

## Graph Not Loading

If your graph is not loading, try the following:

1. Check that you have markdown files with links
2. Verify the files are in the correct format
3. See the [getting started guide](getting-started.md) for setup

## Performance Issues

For large graphs with many nodes:

- Use the search feature to find specific files
- Try different layout options
- Check [performance tips](guides/performance.md)

## Link Detection Problems

The system detects these link formats:

- Standard markdown: `[text](file.md)`
- Obsidian-style: `[[file]]` or `[[file|text]]`

See [API documentation](api/links.md) for more details.
